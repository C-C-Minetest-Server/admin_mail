# Admin mailing list and report

This mod defines two mailing lists, `admin_mail:admins` and `admin_mail:moderators`, for contacting all players with `privs` and `ban` privileges respectively. Additionally, a form accessible via `/report` command is created, giving players a way to submit tickets without messing up with the name of the mailing lists.

This mod requires a very recent version of mail mod (commit [`570cf78`](https://github.com/mt-mods/mail/commit/570cf788ecca9f4174f923b07e46b9bb84c419db) or later) to run, which as of 2024-02-03, has not yet been released into the Content DB. Therefore, it is recommended to download that mod via Git.
